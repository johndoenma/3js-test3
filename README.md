# 3js-test3
A non-npm modified test version of loading a gltf model from Blender using Ektogamat/Anderson Mancini's [ThreeJS Boilerplate](https://github.com/ektogamat/threejs-andy-bolierplate)

[View Test](https://johndoenma.github.io/3js-test3)

This is another test for Tre, seeing if we can use his .glb file of his KCC campus buildings exported from Blender and interactively animate the camera from position to position.

External dependencies:
* Three.js (main 3D js library)
* GLTFLoader (to load .glb file)
* Orbit Controls (to rotate the 3D model)
* TweenJS (to animate the camera)

## Getting Started
You do not need node or npm to run this version, because all dependecies can be found in the js folder, but you do need a local web server to see it working locally.

## Credit
All credit goes to Anderson Mancini and his (Ektogamat)'s [threejs-andy-bolierplate](https://github.com/ektogamat/threejs-andy-bolierplate) üôè Thank you!
